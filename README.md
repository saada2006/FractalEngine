# Fractal Engine

Fractal Engine is an open-source 3D game engine that runs on Linux. Windows support will come soon.

## Building

First, install `libsdl2-dev` via your package manager. Then, use CMake to build the project.

## Everything on The TODO List

* ~~Switch over to shared pointers and stop having memory leaks~~
* Use spdlog instead of whatever I have got going on
* Build a proper event system 
* Figure out how to properly abstract the renderer
